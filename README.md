### Tasks for you

- Write the app :)
- Use as much standards as we do in our [Android Cookbook][5]
- Using RxAndroid and MVP Architecture is a big advantage
- Writing UI programatically is also a big advantage (if you will use Kotlin and Anko, we will love you)
- If you want to add anything extra, just go for it!
- Send it to us as link to dropbox / GDrive / etc..
